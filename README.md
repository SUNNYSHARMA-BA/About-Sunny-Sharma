## 👤 About Me
> I’m a B.Com student currently pursuing the Company Secretary (CS) course, with a strong foundation in finance, taxation, and corporate law. Alongside my academic journey, I’ve developed a deep interest in data analytics and business intelligence.

I’m skilled in Power BI, Excel, and SQL, and have built interactive dashboards on topics like retail sales, HR analytics, and personal finance tracking — all showcased on my GitHub. These projects reflect my ability to transform raw data into meaningful insights for decision-making.

Certified in Google Data Analytics and Google Business Intelligence, I’m focused on blending my finance background with modern analytical tools to solve real-world business problems, especially in retail stores, real estate, personal finance and many more.

I'm passionate about financial literacy, self-development, and using data to empower smarter decisions. I'm currently seeking opportunities where I can grow as a Business Analyst and contribute value through insights and strategy.
